Mines of Midia is a user interface for parsing the drum part out of a midi file and displaying it on a graphical drumset.

This project will be broken up into two separate projects due to time constraints. The first part of the project, will be mainly user interface
stuff, like login, profile stuff, songs, etc. The second half will contain more midi parsing stuff.
