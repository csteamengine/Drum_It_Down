## Goal

The Mines of MIDIa is a web application that helps individuals
learn to play drums. It will feature the ability to play MIDI
files while seeing a graphical representation of the drums being
played. The graphical representation will be in two parts:

1. a drum set image that lights up the different drums as the
   music plays, and
2. a music staff that shows the notes in traditional music notation.
