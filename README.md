# Drum It Down
Drum it down is a project that I have wanted to complete for a long time. I have been a drummer all my life, and after 
years and years of band in school, I still wasn't very good at reading music. I learn by listening to the song, and making 
up my own version. However, that method will only get you so far. There comes a time where you need to look at the music
to know what the drummer is doing at a certain part of a song. That is when you realize drum music is hard to come by without
paying for it. Let's say for a second that I am lucky enough to come by drum sheet music, now what? I already said I'm not 
a strong music reader, so that sheet music might not help me much. That is where Drum It Down comes in.

## Visual Playback
By utilizing MIDI files that drum enthusiast have created, Drum It Down is able to visually playback any song that you can 
imaging. If you can find a midi file, Drum It Down can show you how to play it, provided it has a drum track. 

## Generated Sheet Music
By reading through the MIDI file, Drum It Down is able to generate sheet music for you to view. The goal of this is to help 
you learn to read sheet music. While the song is playing back in real-time, you can follow along on the sheet music. 

## Quality MIDI Files
With an upvoting and downvoting system, you are guaranteed to have quality MIDI files to learn from. If you find a file
that is incredibly accurate, give it an upvote. If you find a file that is bad quality, give it a downvote. 

## Spotify Matching
If your song is a popular song, you can match your MIDI file up with the spotify track. That way you can ensure all track 
and artist information is accurate.
